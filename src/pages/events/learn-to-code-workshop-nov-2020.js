Our instructor gave very thorough and simple instructions to help out us beginners, but I still learned a lot. Overall, a very well run class, and I appreciate it.

                    This "Learn to Code in 90 minutes" workshop will enable students from grades 3-12, with no prior computer science experience, to learn what computer science is and how to create simple projects and games. We will be using JavaScript throughout the workshop. Not only will you be able to learn more about computer science through fun kahoots, but you will also be able to build several hands-on computer science projects and listen to a professional speaker in 90 minutes! We hope to see you there!
