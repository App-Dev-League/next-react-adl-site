        I enjoyed the coding program at App Dev League! It was fun, and I learned many new things, and added on to many things I know. My favorite thing was the Tic-Tac-Toe game, as it shows game designing, something I enjoy alot.â€‹

I hesitated to sign-up, but I eventually did and that was probably the best choice I have made coding-wise before this camp. I didn't know anything about code, but with this camp, I have learned more about coding in more than all of the other classes combined! The greatest thing about this camp is that it is free!!! The instructors are great, and so on, there isn't much you could say is bad, so if you are reading this, you have to try out this camp.

Their mission is relevant to everyone, especially those who are anxious about what's happening in the world right now, that nothing can stop them from learning new things or mastering their skills. As a student, taking the time and making efforts are not a joke. They still manage to contribute to society regardless of their plans and time. I am very grateful for all the help. Thank you for such a wonderful contribution!

                    This CS Winter Boot Camp will enable students from grades 5-12 to explore different areas of computer science, such as website development and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to enable students to delve into different disciplines of computer science to see what catches their interest. We will be using a variety of programming languages, such as Python, HTML, and CSS throughout the workshop. Not only will students be able to learn more about computer science through interactive exercises, but you will also be able to build several hands-on computer science projects! We hope to see you there!
